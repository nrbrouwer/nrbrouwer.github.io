Welcome to my website! I'm Nick, a PhD candidate in the political science department at the University of California, Merced. Previously, I earned my BA from the University of Texas at Dallas in International Political Economy, and a Master's in Global Policy Studies at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, Austin.

My interests largely lay with local and indigenous political institutions. You can find my work published in the *Journal of Politicial Institutions and Political Economy* and the *Annual Review of Political Science*. I am also affiliated with the [PEARS Lab @ UC Merced](https://sites.ucmerced.edu/pears/about) and have experience working with [Social Impact](https://socialimpact.com/).
