Welcome to my website! I'm Nick, a PhD candidate in the political science department at the University of California, Merced. Previously, I earned my BA from the University of Texas at Dallas in International Political Economy, and a Masters in Global Policy Studies at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, Austin.

My interests largely lay with indigenous political institutions and spatial data, as well as the intersection of the two. I am also affiliated with the [PEARS Lab @ UC Merced](https://sites.ucmerced.edu/pears/about) and work as a research assistant with the consulting firm [Social Impact](https://socialimpact.com/) on an international survey project.
