- Advanced Causal Inference (Fall 2024)

### Undergraduate level

- Introduction to Comparative Politics (Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Spring 2023)

## Course Tools

### Protest Game

For some introductory courses, I like to use simple, mutliplayer games where the whole class can participate and learn interesting political science concepts. At some point, I coded a very simple protest/coordination game in oTree which can accomodate both small and large groups. The game moves through 12 rounds where players chose to either attend or skip a protest. The payout each round is determined by both their choice as well as the level of attendance across their group.

Setting up the game is not very difficult. It should take less than 30 minutes in total, Even for those unfamiliar with oTree. You can download all the necessary materials to run the game on oTree Hub from my GitHub repository, linked below. If you have any suggestions for things you would like to see in the game, please feel free to reach out!

### Legislative Simulation Tracker

As part of UC Merced's California Senate simulation course, students are assigned roles, write bills, and take votes. I suggested an easy way to make the information in the simulation more accessible to students and more realistic would be to create a website which tracks the bills and votes. I then put together a simple Quarto website hosted on GitHub which contains all the necessary information for participating students. Essentially, this website servers as a one-stop-shop for information on the positions, bills, and votes of every senator in the simulation. This includes live updating for votes tracked in a Google Sheet.

This project is still in very early stages to get to a minimal viable product, but feel free to check out the development by clicking the button below. Once the project is more developed, if you have any suggestions on additions you would like to see, please feel free to contact me!
