## Early Stage Projects 
---

"Beyond the Reservation Line: The Electoral Consequences of American Indian Migration" <span style="font-size:14px;">with **Alex Zhao**</span>

The urbanization of American Indians has been a trend in native communities for the past 75 years, yet it's effects are rarely studied quantitatively. This project descriptively analyzes this migration, showing trends in American Indian migration over the past Century. Then it looks into how these American Indian migrants impact the electoral outcomes of small urban areas they move to.

"Tribal Legislator Behavior: Evidence from the Cherokee Nation" <span style="font-size:14px;">with **Nate Monroe**</span>

Very little is known about how tribal politicians represent their constitutions in native governments. This project addresses this by examaning the vote choices of Cherokee Nation Councilors. Collecting and coding Cherokee Nation Tribal Council votes over almost 50 years, this project examines trends in how councilors vote. Then, utilizing how some Councilors are elected by at-large communities outside Cherokee land, we explore how responsive Councilors are to variation in voter preferences.
